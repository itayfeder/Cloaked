# Welcome to Cloaked!

## What is Cloaked?
Cloaked is a mod that adds a simple item: Capes! These capes have a variety of looks, and can be placed in your chest slot to display on your back!

You can also use Curios to place the capes on the back slot. If you do that and put an elytra on, it will have a cape-unique texture!

## Where do I find capes?
You can find them in any chest all over the world!
